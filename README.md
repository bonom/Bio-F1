# Introduction
  >Formula 1 is a highly competitive and ever-evolving sport, with teams constantly searching for ways to gain an edge over the competition. In order to meet this challenge, we propose a custom Genetic Algorithm that can simulate a race strategy given data from free practices and compute an optimal strategy for a specific circuit. The algorithm takes into account a variety of factors that can affect race performance, including weather conditions as well as tire choice, pit-stops, fuel weight, and tire wear. By simulating and computing multiple race strategies, the algorithm provides valuable insights and can help make informed strategic decisions, in order to optimize the performance on the track. The algorithm has been evaluated on both a video-game simulation and with real data on tire consumption provided by the tire manufacturer Pirelli. With the help of the race strategy engineers from Pirelli, we have been able to prove the real applicability of the proposed algorithm.

# Requirements

Needed packages to run the project:
- Python 3.11
- numpy
- pandas
- plotly
- tqdm

To create the environment use conda (better):
```bash
conda create -n <environment_name> python=3.11 pandas numpy tqdm plotly
```
or pip:
```bash
python -m venv <environment_name> 
pip install -U pandas numpy tqdm plotly
```

Or you can use the requirements file (inside the environment):
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

There should not be any problems with the packages versions, in case you have some troubles please use the `requirements.txt` file for the versions we used.

# Classes
## Car
A class where there is the elaboration of all the data regarding a car and store them in a *json* file.

## Genetic
This class is where the Evolutionary Algorithm and the Bruteforce are implemented.

## Race - To be removed
This class checks if there are Race data to view in order to understand how the race has performed in the simulation.

## Utils
A class that contains the most general functions used in all the other scripts.

## Weather
A class where the weather is managed in order to pass it to the *Genetic* one.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Usage

The script can be used with several flags in different ways, it starts with the default one:
```bash
python main.py
```

Then flags are:
- `--d`: is a modality for retrieving more runs of the simulation
```bash
python main.py --d
```
- `--c <circuit>`: better if specified, otherwise the script will run the script for all the circuits available. The circuits available are the folders names in the Data folder
```bash
python main.py --c Monza
```
- `--pop <int>`: is the population size of the genetic algorithm
```bash
python main.py --pop 100
```
- `--mut <float>`: is the mutation rate of the genetic algorithm
```bash
python main.py --mut 0.1
```
- `--cross <float>`: is the crossover rate of the genetic algorithm
```bash
python main.py --cross 0.1
```
- `--i <int>`: is the number of iterations of the genetic algorithm
```bash
python main.py --i 100
```
- `--w <weather file>`: is the weather file to use in the simulation, if not specified the script will ask for the weather file to use. Notice that only the weather *txt*s in every circuit data folder are considered
```bash
python main.py --w Sunny.txt
```

It is possible to use more than one flag, for example:
```bash
python main.py --c Monza --pop 100 --mut 0.1 --cross 0.1 --i 100 --w Sunny.txt --d
```
